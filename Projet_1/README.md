##This projet allows to control Led RGB using seriel port

First select the color : red, green or blue

The Arduino returns the color you have chosen. 
If you entered a wrong command, Arduino will ask you to chose between these tree colors.

Then, enter the value in percentage that you want attributed to the chosen color.
If you entered a wrong command (for example 125, witch is not between 0% and 100%), Arduino will ask you to chose another value.
